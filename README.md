# MartingaleSimulation
Simulate the martingale simulation using the power of C++

This is a really simple simulator. Simply fill in the values, and run the simulation. Feel free to use any part of this code in your project, no need to credit me.

A player will continue betting until they run out of balance, or they finished the giving amount of round. When done, the results will be logged in the console.

Example response:

```
Ending profit: 400.000000
Amount of players that won every round: 4/4
```
or
```
Players that went bankrupt: 1/4
Ending profit: -638.000000
Amount of players that won every round: 3/4
```
